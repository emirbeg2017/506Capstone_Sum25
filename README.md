When putting the Global Energy Generation & Capacity (IMF) table in the dataset CapData is called Cap_Table
The Demand table was downloaded from https://ember-energy.org/data/yearly-electricity-data. It was then filtered to only include information about demand. That filtered data set is included in this repo.
The Demand table with in the CapData dataset is called Demand
